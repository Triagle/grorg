#+TITLE: grorg

A command line interface for navigate and querying org mode files
(grep-org, or grorg). It's main advantage over org mode tools is it's
understanding of the org mode syntax, which enables querying that
might be difficult in shell scripts (such as listing all immediate
children of a given header).
